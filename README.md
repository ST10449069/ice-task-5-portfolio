New skills or concepts I learned
CSS Grid and Flexbox: Created responsive layouts using both Grid (for portfolio and blog sections) and Flexbox (for navigation and social links).
Smooth Scrolling: Implemented JavaScript for smooth scrolling to sections when navigation links are clicked.
Responsive Design: Used media queries to ensure the site looks good on all device sizes.
CSS Transitions and Transformations: Added subtle animations and hover effects to improve user experience.

Challenges and Solutions
Fixed Header Overlap: The fixed navigation header was overlapping content when scrolling to sections. I solved this by adding scroll-margin-top to sections and adjusting the JavaScript scroll function.
Color Palette Selection: Choosing a soothing color palette that was also accessible required several iterations. I tested contrast ratios to ensure text remained readable.
Responsive Navigation: Making the navigation work well on mobile devices required restructuring the header layout with flexbox and media queries.

AI or External help
I used YouTube to help me on fixing the overlapping header and making the website work well on multiple different devices.

Improvements with more time
Dark/Light Mode Toggle: I would add a theme switcher to allow users to choose between light and dark modes.
Contact Form: Add a functional contact form with validation instead of just email links.
More Interactive Elements: Add subtle animations to elements as they come into view during scrolling.
Blog: If the blog section grew, I would add a "Load More" button.
